1. **Agent 1: Destination Analyzer (GPT-4o-mini)**: Use `analyze_travel_request` function to extract destination, duration, and purpose
2. **Agent 2: Itinerary Builder (GPT-4o-mini)**: Use `build_itinerary` function to check if information is missing

4. **Agent 1**: If Agent 2 asks for missing info, use `handle_clarification` function to process the clarification
5. **Agent 2**: Create the final itinerary only when all info is complete

**CRITICAL: Use the available functions:**
- Agent 1: Use `analyze_travel_request` and `handle_clarification` functions
- Agent 2: Use `build_itinerary` function

**Proper Feedback Loop**:
- Agent 1 analyzes the request and returns analysis with missing_info if any
- Agent 2 checks the analysis and requests clarification from Agent 1 if info is missing
- Agent 1 processes the clarification request using `handle_clarification` function
- Agent 2 creates the final itinerary when all information is complete

**Debug Messages to Show**:
- "üîç Agent 1: Destination Analyzer (GPT-4o-mini): Extracted [destination, duration, purpose]"
- "‚ùì Agent 2: Itinerary Builder (GPT-4o-mini): Missing [missing_info], requesting clarification from Agent 1"

- "‚úÖ Agent 1: Destination Analyzer (GPT-4o-mini): Updated analysis with user clarification"
- "üìù Agent 2: Itinerary Builder (GPT-4o-mini): Creating itinerary with complete information"

**Key Rules**:
- Agent 1 should NOT hallucinate missing information
- Agent 1 should indicate missing info in the missing_info field
- Agent 2 should request clarification from Agent 1 when info is missing
- Agent 1 should use `handle_clarification` function to process clarification requests
- Only proceed with itinerary creation when all required information is available
- Show debug messages for each step

**Expected Output**:
- Clear day-by-day travel itinerary
- Practical activities and recommendations
- Accommodation and transportation tips
- Budget considerations
